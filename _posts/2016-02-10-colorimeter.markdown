Last Friday I took apart my old Spyder2 monitor colorimeter to see how it works.  Apparently it uses 7 colored filters with a light sensor behind each one,  by comparing the amount of light absorbed by each filter the color on screen is determined.  I decided to take a shot at making my own.


##The Challenge:
- Only use components that I already had in my house
- Finish it in roughly a weekend
- Ideally
