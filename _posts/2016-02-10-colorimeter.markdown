Last Friday I took apart my old Spyder2 monitor colorimeter to see how it works.  Apparently it uses 7 colored filters with a light sensor behind each one,  by comparing the amount of light absorbed by each filter it can determine the color on screen.  I was fascinated by how it worked so I decided to take a shot at making my own.



##Constraints:
- Only use components from around the house
- Finish it in roughly a weekend
- Ideally small enough to be hand held

##The Sensor
First I tackled the most import part, the sensor. I had some color gels used for camera lighting, I chose to use red, green, and blue (the additive primary colors) for even coverage of the color spectrum.

Unfortunately I only had one photo resistor so a servo was used to take measurements through each filter.

##Calibration
After assembling the sensor and the next step was to collect test data for calibration.  An Arduino was used to collect the analong light measurements form the photo resistor and to control the servo. I limited scope to measuring hue, there are 1560 hues in the 24 bit RGB color system, I wrote this [color picker web app](/color) in AngularJS, mounted the sensor onto a calibrated monitor, and setup a python script to iterate through the 1560 hues and record the readings.

With a database of calibration measurements, we now have a set of known values to compare new measurements too.  

##Finishing Touches
Aftr setting a Raspberry Pi as the brains the last step was to create an interface and assemble all of the components into the case, for the "button" to take a measurement I mounted the sensor on springs so a small amount of pressure on the front complete a circuit and trigger the measurement.  An LCD screen displays the RGB and hex values of the measured color, and an RGB led recreates the color.
