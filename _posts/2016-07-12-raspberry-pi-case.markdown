excerpt: Finally covered by bare Raspberry Pi.

I use one of my Raspberry Pis to runs the [@_StormWatch](https://twitter.com/_StormWatch) twitter bot as well as some other automated tasks.  For a few months it's been sitting on my desk bare, running 24/7 and it was long overdue for a case.  I took a look at the available cases and nothing jumped out at me so I designed my own.

I spent some time thinking about interesting geometries, something functional that isn't just another rectangular box.

The model of the Raspberry Pi 2 B is from [GrabCad.com](https://grabcad.com/library/raspberry-pi-2-model-b-3d-cad-assembly-model-2). I used it as a reference for the size of the case and the location of ports and mounting holes.

Luckily I had a nice combination of filament colors on hand. The top is white Inland PLA from my local (1hr away) MicroCenter, and the bottom half is the Clay Red 5 Dollar Filament from [ProtoParadigm.com](http://www.protoparadigm.com/5-filament/clay-red-adv-ingeo-pla-1-75mm/). They have a great choice of colors, and the price makes it easy to grab a variety without having to buy full 1kg spools.
