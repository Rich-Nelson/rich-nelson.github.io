excerpt: For my senior project I was responsible for the design and construction of a fairing for the ASME Human Powered Vehicle Competition
---

For my senior project I was on a team of 4 competing in the ASME Human Powered Vehicle Challenge.  My role was the design and construction of the aerodynamic fairing, while the other three members of the team we're responsible for the frame, drive train, and project management.

At this time I already had a few years of experience with composite construction from building longboards, which was a valuable base of knowledge to build off of when approaching this project. The photos below document the fairing design, fluid dynamics testing, material testing, and construction of the fairing.

##Design

##Construction

![The frame was attached to the fairing with carbon fiber, similar to how the bamboo frame was constructed.  Peelply was used on the inner surface on the fairing during construction to promote secondary bonding to the surface.](/assets/article_images/2010-03-10-aerodynamic-fairing/attaching.jpg)
