excerpt: Paint booth for sealing longboards with water based clear coat, in a dust free environment.

I designed a paint booth to fit our manufacturing space.  Since our machining and finishing takes place in the same room, we needed a clean environment for applying clear coat.

We use a water based clear coat, so fire proofing was not necessary like it would have been for solvent based coatings.
