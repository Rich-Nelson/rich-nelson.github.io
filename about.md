As long as I can remember I've always loved taking things apart to figure out how they work.  When I was 12 I rode my bike into a parked car because I was staring down to watch the chain shift gears. As I've grown' this fascination led to using the knowledge I've gained to improve upon designs and create new things, naturally I got my BSME to turn my passion into a career.

During college I started designing and building longboards. After graduating into a poor job market and economy in 2010 I focusing on growing Nelson Longboards, **within an year and a half I established the company as one of the top 10 longboard companies worldwide** due to my innovative and ergonomic designs. We went on to sell boards directly to customers in over 40 countries and in retail shops around the world.  Over the years I have gained a lot of experience in designing, automating and scaling manufacturing processes. **This resulted in an increase in our our output from 4 to 100 boards per week with minimal additional labor.** I have been responsible for continuous prototyping and product development, including multiple innovations that became standard in the industry. These are just a few of areas in which I've gained experience. Being self employed and running a business required me to be very disciplined and led me to grow both personally and professionally.

Though the business kept me busy I still kept things fresh with side projects (some of which are documented here) where I continue to learn and explore different areas of interest including electronics and programming.
